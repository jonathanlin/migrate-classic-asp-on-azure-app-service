# Classic ASP Docker

This is an updated version of this repo https://github.com/ImranMA/CodeSamples/tree/master/aspClassic-Docker. To demonstrate how a classic ASP application can be containerised and then deployed to a web app for containers (with a Windows service plan)


## Changes
1. Dockerfile has a fixed download reference
2. Added some Classic ASP code to enumerate environment variables to see how these may be injected by Azure Web Apps for Containers.
3. Built some SQL code that accesses data in an Azure SQL database.

## Dockerfile

```
Note that it does appear that you do not need to declare the *ENV* in the Dockerfile as would be the case for Linux containers. But is is probably best to declare this in case this changes for Windows containers in Web App for Containers.

## Environment variables
Following the article here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-custom-container?pivots=container-windows#configure-environment-variables some code was added to the asp page to enumerate the environment variables:

```
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>
        <%
        Set objWSH =  CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
        Set objSystemVariables = objWSH.Environment("SYSTEM")
        For Each strItem In objSystemVariables
            response.write("<p>" & strItem & "</p>")
        Next
        %>
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>USER</i></p>
        <%
        Set objSystemVariables = objWSH.Environment("USER")
        For Each strItem In objSystemVariables
            response.write("<p>" & strItem & "</p>")
        Next
        %>
      </i></p>
```

In the web app configuration a custom application setting was added:
![Web App for Containers settings](https://github.com/jometzg/classicaspdocker/blob/master/appsettings.png)

When the web page is displayed, you can see this has been picked up.
![Picked up by code](https://github.com/jometzg/classicaspdocker/blob/master/onpage.png)

As can be seen, the value _APPSETTING_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=this_is_the_connection_string_ gets correctly injected into the container. This will allow connection strings and other settings to be injected into the application. 

## Getting a specific environment variable

The above code iterates through the set of environment variables. If there is a need to get a specific environment variable, the code will look like:

```
Set objWSH =  CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
conn.open(objWSH.ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%APPSETTING_DSN%"))
```
In the above a web application setting *DSN* is being accessed as *APPSETTING_DSN* and used (in this case) as a connection string to a database connection.

## Accessing an Azure SQL Database
It's often the case that an application need to access an SQL database. For migration to Azure, Azure SQL database is a really good option. This section covers how to setup the database driver so that ADODB code can use an Azure SQL database.

Firstly, the driver needs to be installed in the container. There are several ways to do this, but the following creates a systme DSN that the application can use. I followed some advice from here https://dotnet-cookbook.cfapps.io/kubernetes/asp-with-odbc/
```
RUN Add-OdbcDsn -Name "SampleDSN" `
                -DriverName "\"ODBC Driver 13 For SQL Server\"" `
                -DsnType "System" ` 
                -SetPropertyValue @("\"Server=yourservername.database.windows.net\"", "\"Trusted_Connection=No\"");
```
This creates a DSN named "SampleDSN".

In the ASP code on the page, this DSN is then used to access the database:
```
      Dim objConn
      Set objConn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
      Set objWSH =  CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
      objConn.open(objWSH.ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%APPSETTING_DSN%"))
      Set objCmd = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Command")
      objCmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM dbo.person"
      objCmd.ActiveConnection = objConn

      Set objRS = objCmd.Execute

      Do While Not objRS.EOF
        %><%= objRS("FirstName") %><br><%
        objRS.MoveNext()
      Loop
```
In the above, I had a sample table "person" in the database with a few rows of data. Note we have injected the connection string in the web app settings - as described previously.

## Building the app
In my case i am using following names , please change according to your requirements
Registry Name  = [classicasp.azurecr.io/aspclassic:latest]
Image Name = [aspclassic]

go to the src folder and Build the image . [aspclassic] is the name of container, you can change accordinlgy
```
docker build -t aspclassic -f dockerfile .
```
run the image locally
```
docker run -d -p 8086:80 --name aspclassicapp aspclassic
```

if you need to 'inject' environment variables into a docker run, here's how:
```
docker run -d -p 8086:80 --env APPSETTING_DSN=the-complete-connection-string  --name aspclassicapp aspclassic
```
It should be noted that quoting the connection string may not be necessary, if there are no spaces. Use of single quotes **'** may cause the quotes to be injected too - making the connection string invalid.

Steps to push the image to Azure
Following command will log you into potral
```
az login
```
Login to Azure Container Registry
```
az acr login --name [Registry Name Here]
```
Tag The image with following command
```
docker tag aspclassic classicasp.azurecr.io/aspclassic:latest
docker push classicasp.azurecr.io/aspclassic:latest
```
Then deploy a Web App for Containers, pointing to the container images you just uploaded!

## Other samples
Here is a repo https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-container-samples with a large number of sample Dockerfiles which may be used as a starting point for containerising Windows-based workloads.
